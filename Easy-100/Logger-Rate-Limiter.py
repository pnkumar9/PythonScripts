'''
Design a logger system that receive stream of messages along with its timestamps, each message should be printed if and only if it is not printed in the last 10 seconds.

Given a message and a timestamp (in seconds granularity), return true if the message should be printed in the given timestamp, otherwise returns false.

It is possible that several messages arrive roughly at the same time.

Example:

Logger logger = new Logger();

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 1
logger.shouldPrintMessage(1, "foo"); returns true; 

// logging string "bar" at timestamp 2
logger.shouldPrintMessage(2,"bar"); returns true;

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 3
logger.shouldPrintMessage(3,"foo"); returns false;

// logging string "bar" at timestamp 8
logger.shouldPrintMessage(8,"bar"); returns false;

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 10
logger.shouldPrintMessage(10,"foo"); returns false;

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 11
logger.shouldPrintMessage(11,"foo"); returns true;

The idea is that we keep a hashtable/dictionary with the message as key, 
and its timestamp as the value. 
The hashtable keeps all the unique messages along with the latest timestamp that the message was printed.

Algorithm

We initialize a hashtable/dictionary to keep the messages along with the timestamp.

At the arrival of a new message, the message is eligible to be printed with either of the two conditions as follows:

case 1). we have never seen the message before.

case 2). we have seen the message before, and it was printed more than 10 seconds ago.

In both of the above cases, we would then update the entry that is associated with the message in the hashtable, with the latest timestamp.
